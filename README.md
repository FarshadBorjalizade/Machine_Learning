# Machine_Learning
### These are the machine learning exercises I took in my master's degree
### In this repository I have shared all the small and big exercises I did in the master machine learning course.
## I have done some of them from the scratch and some from the ready-made libraries in Python, which include the following algorithms:
* Perceptron
* Regression
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Principal component analysis
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
*  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Autoencoder
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
